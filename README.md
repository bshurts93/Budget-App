# Budget-App
My version of the budget app from Jonas Schmedtmann's JS Udemy course

This section of the course was the culmination of writing IIFEs, creating modules, and lots of DOM manipulation.
This was a code-along, but I always take creative liberties in changing elements of HTML, CSS and JS to enhance my understanding along the way.
